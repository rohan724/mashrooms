# mashrooms
this project consists of multiple machine learning models used to classify mmashrooms into 2 categories (edible , poisonous)
parameters of several models are tuned using grid search,
file named project 1 have basic ml models  for classification while project 2 consist of ensamble methods such as bagging and voting
pca dimension reduction method is implimented in projecct 2
only neral network models is implimented for deep learning
results of all models are commpared at last in table format
